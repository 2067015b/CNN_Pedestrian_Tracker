        particle_upper_bounds is a vector that represents
            the maximum values of each state
        noise_type must be either 'gaussian' or 'uniform'
        noise_param1 must be either None of a vector with num_states elements.
            If it is set as None, then it is initialized as a vector of zeros.
            If noise_type is gaussian, this parameter represents the means of
            the noise distribution, while if the noise_type is uniform, then
            it represents the lower bounds of the interval
        noise_param2 is similar to noise_param1. If it is None, it is set as a
            vector of ones. When the noise_type is gaussian, it represents the
            standard deviations, while if it is uniform, it is the upper bounds
            of the interval
        maximum_total_weight is the highest value that it is expected to be
            obtained by summing all the weights. This parameter is necessary if
            the weighting function is not bounded or if the real maximum value
            is never reached in real situations. This value should be set as the
            highest value that usually occurs
        final_state_decision_method must be either 'best', 'average' or
            'weighted_average'. If best, the particle with highest weight is
            chosen as the new state. If average, the new state is computed
            from the simple average of all the particles. If weighted_average,
            the state comes from an average of all particles averaged by
            their weights
        noise_dispersion_based_on_weight if set as False, then this class
            behaves the same way as the ParticleFilter parent class
        dispersion_factor adjusts the variance of the noise, the higher the
            dispersion_factor, the higher the variance.
